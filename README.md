ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on diagnostic features extracted from breast mass images. The goal is to assist early detection and support clinical decision-making with reliable, data-driven insights.

ðŸ§  Problem Statement
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide. Early diagnosis significantly improves survival rates. This project leverages the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset to build a classification model that predicts cancer type based on features like radius, texture, perimeter, and concavity
